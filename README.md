# VOIDNET
heavily under construction

## Philosophical points
- **immutability**: all else being equal, immutability is the default.
- intrinsic data indexing. Content Identifiers are it.



## features

### UI
- UÎ™ for creation of of immutable tokens

### tokens
- token deployment
- token temporality (token play)
- storage of tokens on IPFS with data-intrinsic identifiers
- composite tokens
- token union operations

## upcoming
note: 'this' is the closed environment in which a particular actor is operating

- UI color slider
- UI pixel art creation through embedded https://github.com/veixq9/crybrush  
- this.view(:succint)  
- token temporality design
- this.deploy(token convexVM)
- this.explore(other-actor)
- this.actions.copy(token-belonging-to-actor-x)


## notes
some actors may purely be in the business of curating others' creations  
an actor may be assigned its own environment inside a contract  

## roadmap

- search engine
- permissionlessness
- ~~decentralization~~ conflict-free realtime replication

## requirements
- https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion
## Tech

- Clojure
- Clojurescript
- IPFS
- Web3
- EVM
- ConvexVM
- maybe OrbitDB
